## 🗒️ Introduction to B2B Operations

The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”

## ❓ Problem Statement

- Ideally, the purchasing company should adhere to the agreed payment term. However, in reality, they often fail to do so, necessitating the involvement of the Accounts Receivable Department.
- Each business has a specialized Accounts Receivable Department tasked with invoice payment tracking and collection.
- The Accounts Receivable team is in charge of:
    - Gathering overdue invoice payments from clients.
    - Dispatching reminders and follow-ups to clients for pending payments.
    - Overseeing the entire cash inflow process.
    - Assisting the company in receiving payment for the services and products provided.
- Develop a Machine Learning Model that can predict the payment date of an invoice upon its creation in the system.
- Construct a comprehensive Invoice Management Application.
